VMMIGRATE_DISCLAIMER="<h1>Read this carefully to the end</h1>
This tool is a powerfull migration intent to import content from a live Joomla website to a J2.5 or/J3 website.
<br/><br/>It has to be installed on the target website where you have <b>already installed Virtuemart 2.x/3.x without data and simply configure the media paths in VM Configuration</b>
<br/><br/>This tool will transfer all the selected data using the <b>same ids</b> (category id, product id, order id,...) that you have on the source site <b>whenever it is possible</b>. 
<br/><br/>By clicking on the migrate button, all data already present on the target site will be either deleted (if you checked the 'Reset data' step) or updated based on the record id.
<br/><br/>Data already transfered will not be updated again unless you purge in migration history.
<br/><br/>Target website (this one) is recommended to be on the <b>same server</b> as the source site or be able to remotely access the database and the files of the source site
<br/><br/>Even if the component should not write on the source database, we however recommend using a <b>read only</b> database user to access the source database. Better safe than sorry!"
