COM_SPAMBOTCHECK_VIEW_USERS_DESCRIPTION="This component extents the User Plugin Spambotcheck.<br /><br />The major aim of Spambotcheck - Users view is to give you information about suspicious users who were able to register on your website and to help you manage them. Furtherone the component allows you to create trusted users who's login is no longer checked by User Plugin Spambotcheck. If you set a user to trusted he is treated during the login process as if listed in the plugins whitelist.<br /><br />The Spambotcheck - Users view extents Joomla! users table with additional informations relevant for spam protection. It shows the results of User Plugin Spambotcheck survey. The plugin will flag users with suspicious behaviour (i.e. many registrations of different users using the same IP within a short timespan) or suspicious email addresses (i.e. email addresses with more than 3 dots or odd character sequences), attach these information to the user and store it in the database. If flagged as suspicious by User Plugin Spambotcheck, the reason, why a user is flagged is also reported in the note column.<br /><br /><b>NOTE: If you set a user to trusted their suspicion state is set to 'unsuspicious' and the user will no longer be checked by User Plugin Spambotcheck during login process.</b><br /><br /> <b>NOTE: The delete button will completly delete the user from Joomla! users and user_spambot table.</b><br /><br /><b>Note Codes:</b><br /><br />1: => Frequent use of IP. Explanation: A user with the User Id (number noted after the colon/double dot) has registered with the same IP. First occurance of a user who registered with this IP was within timespan set in User Plugin Spambotcheck parameter 'timespan'. Set to suspicious when IP is used more often then set in User Plugin Spambotcheck parameter 'Allowed number'. <br /><br />2: => Suspicious email address format.<br /><br />3: => After the user has registered the IP was flagged within 48 hours as spammer IP in online spambot database.<br /><br />4: => user tried to log in but was blocked because he is listed in a online spambot database."
COM_SPAMBOTCHECK_VIEW_LOGS_DESCRIPTION="This component extents the User Plugin Spambotcheck.<br /><br />The Spambotcheck - Logs view shows you logged data of users that were flagged as spambot users and thus prevented from register or loggin on your website. It's major aim is to show you how heaviliy your website is attacked by spammers and to allow you to remove log data (for example to prevant the database table from growing and growing and becoming too big).<br /><b>NOTE:</b> Data about spambot users will only be logged, if you enable User Plugin Spambotcheck parameter 'Log Spambots to db'".
